DeepPanel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pedrovgs/DeepPanel.svg?token=Kb2RqPaWxFZ8XPxpqvqz&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pedrovgs/DeepPanel)
==================

Python project used to implement **comic vignettes segmentation using a machine learning method named deep learning**.

DeepPanel let's you extract all the panels' location from a comic page **using a machine learning model trained in this repository. This project does not use Open CV but a deep learning model designed for image segmentation based on a [convolutional neural network named U-Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net). We've optimized our model in terms of size and performance for mobile applications.** Powered by [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), DeepPanel is able to find all the panels' location in less than a second. 

You can find this model's application for Android and iOS in these GitHub repositories:

* [DeepPanel for Android](https://github.com/pedrovgs/DeepPanelAndroid).
* [DeepPanel for iOS](https://github.com/pedrovgs/DeepPaneliOS).

Keep in mind, **this artificial intelligence solution is designed to simulate the human reading behavior and it will group panels that are related as a human would do while reading a comic book page.** When analyzing a page we do not use image processing algorithms in order to find the panels. Our solution is based on deep learning. We do not use contour detection algorithms at all even when the samples analysis can look similar. If you are looking for a panels contouring solution you can use Open CV or any other image analysis tools like [this project](https://github.com/njean42/kumiko) does.

All the pages used in our sample project are created by [Peper & Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com) which is a free comic book you should read right now :heart:

## How to use DeepPanel

1. [Install Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).
2. If you are a OSX user remeber to execute the script ``Install Certificates`` you'll find inside the ``Applications/Python3`` installation folder
3. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
4. Install pipenv: ``pip3 install pipenv``
5. Install graphviz with this command: ``brew install graphviz`` or ``apt-get install graphviz``.
6. Create your pipenv enviornment: ``pipenv install``
7. Start pipenv environment: ``pipenv shell``
8. Execute any of the scripts ready to use: 

* ``python DeepPanel.py``: Trains the model saves a file with the result.
* ``python DeepPanelMobile.py``: Exports the already trained model for the mobile libraries.
* ``python DeepPanelTest.py``: Using the already trained and saved model analyzes some pages and saves the results.

## Dataset

Keep in mind you'll have to create your own dataset before training the model. We provide some images as an example but the real dataset used to train the model used in our Android and iOS libraries is not provided. Inside the dataset folder you'll find two folders where you should place your raw pages and the pages you've already analyzed. Remember this is a supervised model and you'll need to create your own dataset to be able to train it.

```
dataset
 | - test
 | ----| - raw
 | ----| - segmentation_mask
 | - training
 | ----| - raw
 | ----| - segmentation_mask
``` 

Images in ``raw`` folders will be ``.jpg`` images. Images inside the ``segmentation_mask`` folder will use a ``.png`` format without alpha, compression, or optimizations. Inside should place pixes with three colors:

* Full RGB blue for background.
* Full RGB red for border.
* Full RGB green for panel content.

<img src="art/maskedPage0.png" width="200"/>

Raw pages and masked pages have to use the same name in different folders.

## Model performance

These are the metrics collected during the model training with our private dataset:

### Accuracy
